        Why Eat Low Carb?
      </h2>
      <div class="panel" id="why-low-carb">
        <p>
          High carbohydrate foods spike the most important hormone in the body, insulin, to high levels. 
          When insulin is present in high levels, the body cannot burn stored fat reserves and instead it stores more fat. 
          Continual high levels of insulin over time lead to the metabolic condition of insulin resistance. 
          The body eventually cannot keep blood levels normal and it causes inflammation, cellular damage, obesity, brain impairment, nerve destruction and finally death.
          <br>
          Protein and fat intake is required to live. Carbohydrate intake is not required to live as the liver can produce carbs as needed from protein and fat intake.
          <br>
          Eating low carbohydrate foods that do not spike insulin and keep it high for long periods of time helps to maintain a healthy weight and avoids chronic inflammation. 
          This is regardless of calorie count which is only a secondary concern. 
          Not snacking between meals will also help to keep the all-important insulin levels down and enable the body to burn stored fat and maintain proper blood sugar levels. 
          Diets featuring low carbohydrate intake and moderate to higher protein and fat intake creates a hormonal balance that leads to health and a lean body composition. 
          Two to three meals a day with no snacking in-between is also beneficial to avoid insulin resistance and its negative impacts.

      <h2>
        What Is Low Carb?
      </h2>
      <div class="panel" id="what-is-low-carb">
        <p>
          A measured guideline for what we consider a daily low carbohydrate lifestyle is about 75g or less of carbohydrates per day. 
          The FDA guidelines recommend people consume 275g to 300g of carbohydrates a day generally.
          While this is fine on occasion we believe a daily amount of carbohydrates in that range for the majority of people will lead to being overweight, 
          having ill health and various physical impairments or limitations as they age.

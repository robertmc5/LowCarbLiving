      What about Fat?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fats, also known as essential fatty acids, are a critically necessary component to human health. Somehow in the last decades the good fats were labeled as harmful and the bad fats were labeled as beneficial. 
      This was an unpunished crime. Millions of people began to eat low-fat or no-fat food products. As a result obesity, coronary artery disease, diabetes, macular degeneration and dementia skyrocketed to unprecedented levels. 
      <br>
      Fat is good for you. Avoid no-fat products as if they were toxic. They replace the missing fat with sugar, fillers, chemicals and artifical flavors that generate cravings and distort how taste buds perceive natural foods. 
      They are the enemy of your health as is most highly processed food products. 
      <br>
      The good fats to include in your diet are grass-fed butter or ghee, lard, tallow, olive oil, avocado oil and coconut oil. That includes bacon grease. Yes, saturated fats are not the bad fats.
      <br>
      It is the poly-unsaturated fats, also refered to as Omega-6 fatty acids, that come from vegetable oils that are causing inflammation in humans. The two worst offenders harming most people are soybean oil and corn oil. 
      Avoid them both if at all possible, though they are in most grocery store food products. Other harmful oils in this seed oil category include canola oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil and sunflower oil. Please steer clear of them. 
      <br>
      Most of your calories should come from fat. Fat makes your meals taste good and satisfies your hunger, so you don't crave eating again soon. Fat does not make you fat. Sugar makes you fat.

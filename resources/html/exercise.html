    <h2>
      Is exercise important?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Exercise is very important to overall health. From improving the cardiovascular system to maintaining mental health, a well person is a physically active one.
      <br>
      This activity does not need to be extreme. A brisk walk for 30 minutes a day, five days out of seven is a good foundation, for instance. 
      Add a short burst of resistance training or high intensity training to that two days out of seven and health risks go down. Awareness and moderation are necessary to avoid injury, of course.
      <br>
      However, exercise does not play much of a role in weight control. The average person should not expect working out to cause them to lose weight. 
      While there are exceptions, for most people a change in eating patterns is what affects how much fat they have on their body. Even handicapped individuals that cannot move very much can control their weight purely with what they choose to eat on a daily basis.
      <br>
      Lose weight through diet, nutrition, good sleep and reduced stress. Exercise to be healthy, less stressed and physically flexible and strong.

      What are Low Carb foods?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Low Carb foods have little to no sugar or starches in them. Generally this means meat and vegetables.
      <br>
      The best meats are either beef or fatty fish like salmon. These have lots of bioavailable nutrients the body needs and critical protein. 
      Also chicken, pork and shellfish are alternatives to getting the protein the body requires. Any fresh vegetables are generally good to consume except starchy ones like potatos or corn.
      They have few carbs and they also contain fiber and vitamins. The fiber causes slow absorption so that insulin is not spiked. It also feeds the good bacteria in the stomach.
      <br>
      Most fruits however have high amounts of sugar and therefore spike insulin. This is especially true of juices that strip out the fiber. So fruits are not low carb. 
      The exception is berries. Particularly strawberries, raspberries or black berries. These are acceptable and beneficial in moderate amounts.
      <br>
      Also fat is low carb and has no negative impact on insulin. So preparing meals with butter, lard, olive oil or avocado oil is fine. 
      And most tree nuts in moderation are good although cashews are a bit carby. However, nuts do have a lot of calories so limit the amount. Eating fat does not make you fat. Eating sugar or grains that mimic sugar is primarily what makes you fat. 
      <br>
      A special mention of the avocado, which is the emblem of our company. It is almost a perfect food. It is high in critical potassium, nutrients, good fat and of course, it is low carb.

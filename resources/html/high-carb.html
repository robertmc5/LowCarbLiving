      What are High Carb foods?
    </h2>
    <p>
      High Carb foods usually contain sugar, grain or starch.
      <br>
      People wanting a healthy insulin sensitivity should avoid sweetened beverages like soda and fruit juice most of all. Just cutting those out will reap huge rewards. Fructose is the most damaging type of sugar to the body. 
      Processed food with high fructose corn syrup, which is most items in the grocery store, as well as fruit juices, which is fructose, will spike insulin severely. Avoid these.
      <br>
      Grains like breads, waffles, pancakes, crackers, pastries, anything with dough or breading, noodles and even rice are high carb and harmful if consumed in excess. This is despite conflicting information from established sources. 
      These dense carbs immediately convert to sugar in the body. If your not working a back-breaking day doing manual labor for ten hours on a farm, then these should be seen as occasional treats just like sugary sweets.
      <br>
      Starches like corn, potatos or sweet potatos may not be quite as bad as the previous categories. However, they are still too high in carbs to be consumed daily. They will prevent your body from burning fat. Limit these substantially.
      <br>
      The last mention is alcohol. It is high carb which means it should not be consumed often. The lowest carb choice would be white wine.
